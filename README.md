# Covid19Repository
 
We can run the GettingCovid19Data jupyter file to extract the real time numnber of covid-19 cases in each country. Other than total cases, we can get number of recovered cases, number of serious patients, active cases, total number of test performed in every country,total number of test performed per million people an number of death per million people

The data is extracted from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ using beautiful soup library of python. All the real time data will be saved to coviddata.csv file
